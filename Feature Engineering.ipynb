Eliminating Redundant Features\n","\n","- ```'children_eligible_for_free_lunch'``` and ```'children_in_poverty'``` are essentially the same since children in poverty are the very ones that would be eligible for free lunch; there is strong overlap with ```'children_in_single_parent_households'```, but is not synonymous with them.\n","- ```'gini_index'``` and ```'income_inequality'``` are essentially the same also\n","- ```'single_parent_households'``` and ```'children_in_single_parent_households'``` seem redundant, but would like input on that matter\n","- eliminate ```'poverty'``` as it is redundant with ```'children_in_poverty'```\n","- ```'pct_aapi'``` shoudl be removed since it is just an amalgam of ```'pct_asian'``` and ```'pct_nhpi'```\n","-  ```'high_school_completion'``` and ```'high_school_graduation'```, as well as ```'some_college'``` and ```'college_completion'```\n","-  feature enginneer industry categories:\n","    - ```'pct_agriculture_hunting_and_mining'```,

```'pct_wholesale_trade'```, ```'pct_professional_management_and_scientific_services'```,\n","-  remove occupation categories (having both would be redundant):\n","    -  ```'pct_mgmt_bus_sci_art_occupations', 'pct_nat_res_constr_maint_occupations',  'pct_prod_transp_mat_moving_occupations', 'pct_sales_and_office_occupations', 'pct_service_occupations'```\n","- ```'severe_housing_problems'``` is a composite score of the following three:\n","```'pct_households_with_high_housing_costs','pct_households_with_lack_of_kitchen_or_plumbing_facilities','pct_households_with_overcrowding'```, so we keep one or the other\n","\n","\n","\n","- Use the CHR website definitions in deciding whether to eliminate redundant features or combining features:\n","    - remaining Health Behaviors: ```'access_to_exercise_opportunities', 'adult_obesity', 'physical_inactivity', 'adult_smoking', 'alcohol_impaired_driving_deaths', 'excessive_drinking', 'food_environment_index', 'food_insecurity', 'limited_access_to_healthy_foods', 'insufficient_sleep',  'sexually_transmitted_infections', 'teen_births'```, here we have the food and inactivity/obesity features\n","        - ```'food_insecurity'``` and ```'limited_access_to_healthy_foods'``` are conceptually very similar, perhaps combining them would be best\n","        - ```'access_to_exercise_opportunities'``` and  ```'physical_inactivity'``` are conceptually similar also, where they are reporting two sides of the coin, where one is reporting no leisure-time physical inactivity and the other access to locations for physical activity\n","        - we could find the average of the ```'access_to_exercise_opportunities'``` and ```1 - 'physical_inactivity'```\n","    - Demographics: ```'pct_65_and_older', 'pct_asian', 'pct_female', 'pct_hispanic', 'pct_indigenous', 'pct_non_hispanic_black', 'pct_non_hispanic_white', 'pct_not_proficient_in_english', 'pct_rural', 'pct_under_18'```, we should drop one of the race categories at least and/or form a diversity index\n","        - keeping individual racial categories will allow us to tie one of the groups to greater life expectancy (we know ```pct_asian``` is more correlated with such counties, we would expect ```pct_white``` to be correlated due to greater wealth amongst those populations)\n","        - just like we don't have ```pct_urban``` and ```pct_rural``` and ```pct_male``` and ```pct_female```, keeping all the racial categories would create collinearity\n","    - Social and Economic Factors: ```'children_in_poverty', 'college_completion', 'gender_pay_gap', 'gini_index', 'high_school_completion', 'injury_deaths', 'median_household_income', 'severe_housing_cost_burden', 'single_parent_households', 'social_associations', 'unemployment_rate', 'violent_crime', 'motor_vehicle_crash_deaths```\n","    - Clinical Care:  ```'dentists', 'mammography_screening', 'mental_health_providers', 'other_pcp', 'pcp', 'preventable_hospital_stays','ratio_of_pop_to_dentists', 'ratio_of_pop_to_mental_health', 'ratio_of_pop_to_pcp', 'ratio_of_pop_to_pcp_other_than_physicians', 'uninsured_adults'``` - we can keep ```'ratio_of_pop...'``` and drop the following:  ```'dentists', 'pcp', 'mental_health_providers', 'other_pcp'```, as they are synonymous with each other\n","    - Physical Environment: ```'air_pollution_particulate_matter', 'drinking_water_violations', 'driving_alone_to_work', 'homeownership', 'long_commute_driving_alone', 'severe_housing_problems'```\n","        - here driving alone and long commute driving alone seems redundant, keep ```\"driving_alone_to_work\"```\n","    - Health Outcomes: ```'diabetes_prevalence', 'frequent_mental_distress', 'hiv_prevalence', 'low_birthweight', 'poor_mental_health_days', 'poor_or_fair_health', 'poor_physical_health_days',  'premature_age_adjusted_mortality', 'premature_death', 'life_expectancy'```, here we can combine or eliminate the poor health and the premature mortality/death features\n","        - I know Christine was highlighting the importance of psychological factors in life expectancy, we should keep ```\"poor_mental_health_days\"```\n","        - ```\"poor_mental_health_days\"``` and ```\"poor_physical_health_days\"``` are representatives of average number of days respondents reporting poor mental or physical health, while ```\"poor_or_fair_health\"``` is the percentage of adults reporting fair or poor health, eliminate ```\"poor_physical_health_days\"``` as combining ```\"poor_physical_health_days\"```\n","        - ```'premature_age_adjusted_mortality'``` and ```'premature_death'``` are the same concepts where one represents the average number of years lost and the other represents the number of deaths among residents under age 75 per 100,000 population, keep the latter\n","\n","- Additional thoughts:\n","    - there could be strong overlap with adult obesity and diabetes prevalence\n","    - frequent_mental_distress and poor_mental_health_days could also have strong overlap\n","\n","- Recent Changes:\n","    - instead of feature engineering the industry categories, I opted to keep the ones that were the most correlated with life expectancy, i.e. ```'pct_finance_insurance_and_real_estate'``` and ```'pct_professional_management_and_scientific_services'```\n","    - I also opted to keep the racial categories that are the most correlated with life expectancy:  ```'pct_non_hispanic_white', 'pct_hispanic', 'pct_asian'```\n","    - Upon closer inspection of the features, ```'ratio_to_pop_to_pcp', 'pcp', 'dentists', 'ratio_to_pop_to_dentists', 'mental_health_providers',
